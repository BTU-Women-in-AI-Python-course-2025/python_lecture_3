# 📚 Higher-Order Functions with Lambda

## Objective
Implement higher-order functions using lambda functions.

## Requirements

1. **Define the Function**

   Create the `apply_operation` function with the following signature:

   ```python
   def apply_operation(numbers, operation):
       """
       Apply the given operation to each element in the list of numbers.
       
       :param numbers: List of numbers to be processed.
       :param operation: A function that defines the operation to apply to each element.
       :return: A new list with the operation applied to each element.
       """
       return [operation(number) for number in numbers]


## Example input and output

input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Squared: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Filtered (odd numbers): [1, 3, 5]
